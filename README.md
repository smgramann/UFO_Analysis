# UFO Sightings Analysis

### Purpose

A webpage was constructed to share UFO sightings data and, after further consideration, allowing users to filter the data on multiple criteria at the same time would be an even more effective way to share the data.  Table filters were added for date, city, state, county, and shape of UFO for each sighting.


## Analysis

### Results

This webpage allows for the user to be general or very specific in setting criteria for their data search.  By leaving the filters blank or applying criteria to one filter, the search remains fairly broad and someone could look at trends across many cases.

Alternatively, a user could become very specific on multiple criteria in order to review a small set or single case to gather more detail.

## Summary

While this design provides a user with the ability to review the data based on specific preferences, there are drawbacks to how this is organized.  Currently, there is little information provided to the user as to the date range of the data set as well as the cities, states, countries, and shapes represented in the dataset so itâ€™s likely to make selections that yield no results.  To address that, drop down boxes to select criteria would assist the user.

One other drawback is the organization of a relatively small dataset that becomes even smaller when filtered.  To address that issue the data could be reorganized to provide a few other categories to filter on including the following for each sighting:  month, year, and region of country.  A keyword search on the comment field would also add a different layer of search detail to the page.
